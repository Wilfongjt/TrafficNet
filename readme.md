# TrafficNet
Traffic Net is a traffic simulation. Cars drive around the network making random turns, creating traffic jams, and riding bumpers. 

# Application Road Map

## Upcoming Features

* Animate the cars to refect model changes
* Create real world road network
* Create fixed path routing (i.e., bus routes)
* Place traffic devices on road (i.e., counters, pollution detectors)
* Place traffic signs on road 

## Completed Features

* Update Map Key with fire engine
* Stopping car when fire engine approaches from behind
* Fire Engine
* Tailgating
* Random turns at intersections
* Write network state to console.log (state button)
* Step a single frame at a time (step button)
* Animate the cars to refect traffic changes over time
* Start and stop model (start and stop buttons)
* Port traffic model from Java
* Automatically generate cars on road network using SVG
* Initialize road network using SVG
* Build a JSON file to describe a road network (multi-segment roads, one way roads, speed-limit by road, one or more turns, dead ends)
* Build a self-contained application to model traffic
## Issues
* Page hicups when start button is pressed</li>
* Traffic network color is too light
* Traffic network is too big for phone
